# Web-scraping

In this project I scrape data from the website of the romanian store SnowSports.
As a snowboarder, Iâ€™m interested in finding good deals on specific gear and I think this project showcases my technical skills with Python and data analysis tools. Also, this project demonstrates my abilities to:
- extract information from websites (web scraping);
- process and analyze the extracted data using libraries (data analysis);
- set up a program to automatically check and save price information at regular intervals (automation).
